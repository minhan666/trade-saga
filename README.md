## üöÄ Running the Project Locally

To run and test the project on your local machine, follow these steps.

1.  **Start the local replica:** This command starts the local Internet Computer replica in the background.

    ```bash
    dfx start --background
    ```

2.  **Deploy the canisters:** This command deploys your canisters to the local replica and generates the necessary interface bindings.

    ```bash
    dfx deploy
    ```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.
